## About

In the early 80's, I taught myself 6502 Assembly language when I was 12

About the same time I figured out how to programatically use the Joystick 'input' ports, the default, as 'output' ports to control "The outside world".
This was my Arduino in the early 80's controlling motors, lights, relays, etc.  

I have extensive experience in schematic and PCB design, firmware programming (Arduino, ATtiny, ESP32, ESP8266, PIC, XIAO_NR54L15, etc.), web design, application design, and 3D modeling.

My background includes roles at National Semiconductor, Allied High Tech Products, Parallax Inc., and at Sabolich Prosthetic Research and Development department

## Experience

### Lead Software and Automation Engineer — CODEX Energy
*Jun 2022 – April 2025*

- I led the full-stack development of a custom, highly scalable, and robust industrial communication system
- Facing constraints posed by supply chain shortages of specialized CANbus ICs., I engineered an innovative new hardware design with components that were more readily available.
- Designed a "Fuzzy Logic" communication approach to create a self healing system with increased bandwidth

### Project Manager, designer, programmer — Oklahoma Robotics LLC.
*Jun 2019 – Jun 2022*

- Conceived, designed and tested electronic circuit prototypes to prove concepts and guide
designs
- Wrote programs using a variety of computer languages, such as PIC microcontroller
Assembly, Arduino, Perl, Python, Javascript, and native 4DSystem
- Collaborated with mechanical engineers to resolve product development and maintenance
issues.

### Software Programmer — 4kConcepts
*Feb 2014 – Mar 2019*

- Designed and tested forensic machines to reverse engineer IC’s
- Conceived, designed and tested electronic circuit prototypes to prove concepts and guide
designs.
- Designed, tested and evaluated mechanical and electro-mechanical devices and systems.
- Designed, developed and implemented firmware to support new product concepts on
embedded systems.
- Collaborated with mechanical engineers to resolve product development and maintenance
issues.

### IC Layout Engineer — Parallax Inc.
*Jun 2005 – Oct 2014*

- This is an educational robotics company with several micro controllers and interface
equipment. i.e. Sensors, Motors, Accelerometers, Gyro's, etc.
- Utilized Laker Software for the creation and implementation of layout design workflows.
- Designed Full custom IC layout on a multi core processor
- Provided countless code example demonstrations for our customer database explaining
how to interface and use many different kinds of sensors, devices and communications
protocols we had to offer.

### Layout Mask Designer IV — National Semiconductor
*Jun 2000 – Jun 2005*

- Full custom analog and digital IC layout for a variety of products:

    * Cell Phone Chipsets during the pre-cell phone boom of 2000 to 2005
    * 10/100/1000 MacPhy Ethernet cards
    * Sony Playstation MAC controller
    * HP color printer cartridge driver modification
    * High speed ADC used in Foveon cameras
    * Noise cancellation IC's for Qualcomm
    * High-speed SerDes communication
    * ADCs and DACs ranging from 2.5 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s
    * Standard cell library and characterization for a target 110nm Process

- Collaborated with engineers to discuss existing and potential engineering projects and
products.
- Worked efficiently under strict deadlines to make sure that new products were available
for scheduled public releases

### Electronic Design Specialist — Sabolich Prosthetics
*Jun 1990 – Jun 2000*

- This is a Prosthetic Research and Development facility
    * Worked on many SBIR funded projects
    * Provided technical support for major clinical trials.
    * Human Gait Analysis (Kinesiology physics)
    * Dual US patent holder
        o Pressure ulcer condition sensing and monitoring …. US 6287253 B1
        o System and method for providing a sense of feel in a prosthetic or sensory
        impaired limb …. US 6500210 B1

- Coded all device software and designed all board layouts for sensory systems below:
    * S.O.F. (Sense of Feel) prosthetic device allowing amputees to electrically “feel” varying amounts of pressure associated with sensors located at the end of a prosthetic arm or leg.
    * Hot & Cold prosthetic device utilizing the Peltier effect to transfer temperature from the end of a prosthetic arm or leg to the end of a residual limb.
    * Audio EMG testers used for training new patients to help develop better muscle control for myo-electric prosthetics.
    * A proportional closed-loop motor speed controller that could control multiple motors (elbow, wrist, hand) from a single pair of myo-electric sensors located on various complementary muscles. Implemented motor noise cancellation feedback techniques in design.
    * Developed a pulse induction pressure sensor array, initially created for amputees to wear as an in-sole for detecting pressure on the bottom of a prosthetic foot, coined PNS or(Pressure Notification System). It was soon realized that this sensor would be a valuable tool for diabetic patients who are at a potential risk for losing a leg. Monitoring pressure levels against duration to provide a warning to the wearer coined: NFPS, or(Neuropathic Foot Protection System).
    * Developed SEGA (Sonar Equipped Glasses Assistant), a prototype designed to assist the blind by producing dynamic sound cues that the wearer could easily comprehend.
