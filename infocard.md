    * US Patent 6,500,210 B1 - [System and method for providing a sense of feel in a prosthetic or sensory impaired limb](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6500210B1/en)

- Designed an audio [Spectrum Analyzer](https://github.com/BeauSchwabe/Audio-Spectrum-Analyzer/blob/main/Propeller%20Spectrum%20Analyzer%20for%20Audio.pdf) from scratch simply for a proof of concept.



## Professional Background

### Lead Software and Automation Engineer — CODEX Energy
*Jun 2022 – April 2025*

- I led the full-stack development of a custom, highly scalable, and robust industrial communication system.
- Facing constraints posed by supply chain shortages of specialized ICs., I engineered an innovative new hardware design with components that were more readily available.
- Designed a "Fuzzy Logic" communication architecture to increase bandwidth and create a self healing system.
- Designed custom PCBs and schematics throughout the entire communications system.

### Project Manager, designer, programmer — Oklahoma Robotics LLC.
*Jun 2019 – Jun 2022*

- Conceived, designed and tested electronic circuit prototypes to prove concepts and guide designs based on client's request.
- Wrote programs using a variety of computer languages, such as PIC microcontroller Assembly, Arduino, Perl, Python, Javascript, and native 4DSystem.
- Collaborated with mechanical engineers to resolve product development and maintenance issues.

### Software Programmer — 4kConcepts
*Feb 2014 – Mar 2019*

- Designed and tested forensic machines to reverse engineer IC’s.
- Conceived, designed and tested electronic circuit prototypes to prove concepts and guide designs.
- Designed, tested and evaluated mechanical and electro-mechanical devices and systems.
- Designed, developed and implemented firmware to support new product concepts on embedded systems.
- Collaborated with mechanical engineers to resolve product development and maintenance issues.

### IC Layout Engineer — Parallax Inc.
*Jun 2005 – Oct 2014*

- This is an educational robotics company with several micro controllers and interface
equipment. i.e. Sensors, Motors, Accelerometers, Gyros, etc.
- Utilized Laker Software for the creation and implementation of layout design workflows.
- Designed Full custom IC layout on a multi core processor
- Provided countless code example demonstrations for our customer database explaining how to interface and use many different kinds of sensors, devices and communications protocols we had to offer.

### Layout Mask Designer IV — National Semiconductor
*Jun 2000 – Jun 2005*

- Full custom analog and digital IC layout for a variety of products:

    * Cell Phone Chipsets during the pre-cell phone boom of 2000 to 2005
    * 10/100/1000 MacPhy Ethernet cards
    * Sony Playstation MAC controller
    * HP color printer cartridge driver modification
    * High speed ADC used in Foveon cameras
    * Noise cancellation IC's for Qualcomm
    * High-speed SerDes communication
    * ADCs and DACs ranging from 2.5 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s
    * Standard cell library and characterization for a target 110nm process
    * Developed test structures in 65nm and 45nm process

- Collaborated with engineers to discuss existing and potential engineering projects and products.
- Worked efficiently under strict deadlines to make sure that new products were available for scheduled public releases.

### Electronic Design Specialist — Sabolich Prosthetics
*Jun 1990 – Jun 2000*

- This is a Prosthetic Research and Development facility
    * Worked on many SBIR funded projects
    * Provided technical support for major clinical trials.
    * Human Gait Analysis (Kinesiology physics)
    * Dual US patent holder
        o US 6287253 B1 - Pressure ulcer condition sensing and monitoring.
        o US 6500210 B1 - System and method for providing a sense of feel in a prosthetic or sensory impaired limb.

- Coded all device software and designed all board layouts for sensory systems below:
    * S.O.F. (Sense of Feel) prosthetic device allowing amputees to electrically “feel” varying amounts of pressure associated with sensors located at the end of a prosthetic arm or leg.
    * Hot & Cold prosthetic device utilizing the Peltier effect to transfer temperature from the end of a prosthetic arm or leg to the end of a residual limb.
    * Audio EMG testers used for training new patients to help develop better muscle control for myo-electric prosthetics.
    * A proportional closed-loop motor speed controller that could control multiple motors (elbow, wrist, hand) from a single pair of myo-electric sensors located on various complementary muscles. Implemented motor noise cancellation feedback techniques in design.
    * Developed a pulse induction pressure sensor array, initially created for amputees to wear as an in-sole for detecting pressure on the bottom of a prosthetic foot, coined PNS or(Pressure Notification System). It was soon realized that this sensor would be a valuable tool for diabetic patients who are at a potential risk for losing a leg. Monitoring pressure levels against duration to provide a warning to the wearer coined: NFPS, or(Neuropathic Foot Protection System).
    * Developed SEGA (Sonar Equipped Glasses Assistant), a prototype designed to assist the blind by producing dynamic sound cues that the wearer could easily comprehend.
